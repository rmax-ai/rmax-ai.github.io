### [Agent-First Software Engineering](/notes/agent-first-software-engineering/)
A practical description of an agent-first workflow where engineering shifts from typing code to designing boundaries.

### [Typing Code Is Solved](/notes/typing-code-is-solved/)
Why the bottleneck in software engineering is no longer typing code, but context and judgment.

<!-- ABOUT -->
## About
I’m Max, a software engineer focused on data-intensive systems, cloud platforms, and agent-assisted development. I work on problems where scale, constraints, and decision-making matter more than code volume. Increasingly, my focus is on how humans and AI agents collaborate: humans define intent and boundaries; agents execute within them. This site is where I publish technical notes, essays, and experiments on software engineering, systems thinking, and applied AI—written to clarify thinking, not to chase trends.
